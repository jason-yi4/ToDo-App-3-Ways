4 slightly different apps that all effectively do the same thing: a to-do list.

The apps in this repository are just an exercise in programming in different languages and environments.

**Contents:**

1. _Web-based_ using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
>- Currently not utilizing any backend framework or web hosting service.
>- The app stores data locally in the web pages localStorage memory.
2. _CLI-based_ using Python
3. _GUI-based_ using Java
